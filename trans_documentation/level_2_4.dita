        <p>Umlauts are transcribed according to the original, i.&#x202f;e. the umlauts in the common
            forms <tt>Ä</tt>, <tt>Ö</tt>, <tt>Ü</tt>, <tt>ä</tt>, <tt>ö</tt>, <tt>ü</tt> are
            distinguished from those which are marked by a superscript <tt>e</tt> over a vowel. In
            the superscript e over a vowel, the graph is formed by a combination of two characters
            (e.&#x202f;g. <codeph>u&amp;#x0364;</codeph>).</p>
