    <title>Tables (TableRegion)</title>
    <body>
        <p>Tables are graphically structured information arranged in columns and rows. This
            structure can be indicated by lines which are often left out though. In these cases, the
            separation of the contents is made clear by special tabs and spaces. There are many
            further variations of tables which cannot be described here.</p>
        <p>It is essential that all these regions containing figures or text are labelled as
            TableRegions. In cases of simply structured tables (as described above), the number of
            the columns and rows must be entered for the table. The cell contents themselves are to
            be recorded row by row as TextRegion/paragraph separated by tabs.</p>
        <p>Contents of complex tables that exceed the simple scheme are not recorded. In these
            cases, only the TableRegion is indicated. </p>
