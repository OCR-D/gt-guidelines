# Transcription guidelines for the production of Ground-Truth for training and evaluation of OCR programs as well as documentation of existing Ground-Truth data within the project OCR-D
Version 1.0 2018-11-20 

## First Steps
### Tip:
Work with an XML editor. For the first steps an Oxygen editor with trial license is sufficient, the full functionality is also offered with this version. As an alternative to the Oxygen Editor, you can also use [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/).

The DITA Open-tool-kit can be used to create presentation formats
([DITA-Open-tool-kit](http://www.dita-ot.org/)).

1. The **documentation** folder contains the file **ocrd.ditamap**,
open it in an XML editor (Oxygen editor recommended).
2. In the ditamap **ocrd.ditamap** you can jump to the requested topic.
3. The folder **pagexml_documentation** contains the automatically created page-xml documentation.

**Note:** The documentation is available in German language.
