    <context><p>From a structural point of view, a book consists of different page types and the
                pages contain different regions with different structures and content. In
                particular, the TextRegion can be specified in more detail as a column title,
                heading, paragraph region, and so on... Within these regions, the individual texts
                can show typographical features that can also be labelled..</p>The layout and
            structure analysis should be done in the proposed steps:</context>
