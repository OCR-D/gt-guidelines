    <p>The diacritics are generally regarded as one sign consisting of a basic sign and a diacritic. If
            the diacritics exist as a single character, the appropriate code point from the
            standardized coding tables (Unicode) is used. If no Unicode decoding is available as a
            single character, a character combination is realized by using the Unicode entities from
            the <b>Combining Diacritical Marks</b> Unicode block, e.g. the superscript <tt>o</tt>
            over <tt>u</tt> or <tt>U</tt> (<tt>&#x0366;, COMBINING LATIN SMALL LETTER
            O</tt>).</p>
    <p>When using combinable characters, write the basic character followed "seamlessly" by the
            diacritic. (e.g. u&#x0366; uͦ).</p>
    <p>The spelling for the <tt>c-Cedille</tt> (<tt>ç, U+00E7, LATIN SMALL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA</tt>),
            the <tt>e caudata</tt> (<tt>ę, &#x0119;, LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH OGONEK</tt>) in
            the meaning <tt>ae</tt> or the <tt>e with trema</tt> (<tt>ë, &#x00EB;, LATIN SMALL
                LETTER E WITH DIAERESIS</tt>) is done without the <b>Combining Diacritical
            Marks</b>.</p>
    <p>The transcription is based on the German or Latin character set. Characters of other
            alphabets (Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, etc.) are realized using their corresponding Unicode
            entities.</p>
