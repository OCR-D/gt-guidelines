  <title>Numbers</title>
  <body>
    <p>Numbers in printed text can have different functions. E.g. superscript numbers can represent
      references in the form of footnotes or endnotes. Mathematical functions can also be expressed
      with numbers.</p>
    <p>Generally, numbers are to be transcribed as such. If the numbers are set superscript or
      subscript, they are transcribed as specific <b>Unicode hexadecimal entity</b>.</p>
    <p>If <b>large numbers</b> are printed <b>in blocks</b>, all spaces are to be copied according to
      the original.  </p>
    <p>For <b>numeric blocks with a comma, no</b> space is set after the comma. If there is a space,
      transcribe it.</p>
