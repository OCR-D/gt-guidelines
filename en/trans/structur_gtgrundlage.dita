  <shortdesc>The OCR-D structure Ground Truth corpus contains publications from the period 1500 to
        1900.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>The content of the corpus is based on manually entered zoning data, which were compiled
            in the course of the DFG project German Text Archive. This data was used to support
            manual transcription using the double keying method. The zones mark exclusively
            quadratic regions on the digital copy. The digital copies themselves were not altered
            (cropped, dewarped). In contrast to the element repertoire of the PAGE format, parts of
            the data were indexed more deeply as part of the DFG project German Text Archive. This
            in-depth indexing is recorded as the value of the <tt>custom-Atribut</tt>.</p>
