<shortdesc>Guidelines for the layout and structure of printed texts for use as Ground
            Truth</shortdesc>
</abstract>
    <body>
        <p>The purpose of providing Ground-Truth with layout and structure information is to ensure
            that both in the training process and in the end result of text recognition (OCR+OLR),
            all regions recognizable on a page can be recognized and classified according to the
            requirements. The trained models should contribute to realizing the full text
            recognition of the prints from the 16thâ€“18th century as a mass application and enable
            the text accuracy in the overall result of the text recognition process to meet the
            highest scientific requirements. As with the text transcription, the Ground-Truth can be
            available in different recognition depths (levels). </p>
