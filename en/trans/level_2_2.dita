    <p>The <b>technical printing conditions</b> are reproduced and an interpretation of signs is
            oriented towards their <b>use in the language and writing system</b>. For example,
            regarding ligatures, <b>only independent graphemes (vocal ligatures)</b> with a specific
            code point are reproduced using <b>standardized codes</b> (Unicode). <b>Ligatures
                resulting from the printing technology (consonant ligatures)</b> are generally
                <b>split up</b>. The information ligature is documented as a formatting
            specification (such as bold, italic...) in the Ground Truth. </p>
    <p>If the character can only be formed from a combination of two characters within the
            Unicode standard, this combination shall be used and preferred to the encodings defined
            by the coordinating project.</p>
    <p>Spaces are only reproduced as separators of words.</p>
    <p>Punctuation marks are always added to the preceding word.</p>
