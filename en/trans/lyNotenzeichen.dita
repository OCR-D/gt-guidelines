  <title>Notes (MusicRegion)</title>
  <body>
    <p>Musical notations of all kinds (historical, modern or neumes) are marked as such. If, in
            the case of songs, texts are below individual music staves and a clear separation is
            discernible, each system (also referred to as a stave) is marked as a stave region, the
            texts as a text region. However, if texts are integrated directly into bracketed staves,
            the text is not considered as such and the entire region is marked as a stave
            region.</p>
