    <p>In level 2, the separator is viewed and marked according to its function. The separator
            clearly separates two parts from each other by different design elements (lines, dots,
            stars). If a vignette or specially designed decoration appears at the end of a page, it
            should be checkek whether it is an individually designed decoration or vignette. If it
            is individual, the book decoration is marked as <i>Graphic</i>.</p>
